## What is OWASP?

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit foundation dedicated to improving software security. It offers unbiased, practical information about application security. The OWASP Top 10 specifically identifies the most critical web application security risks. This list provides a foundational understanding for developers, security professionals, and organizations to prioritize their security efforts. It represents a consensus view of the most common and impactful vulnerabilities facing web applications.

## Broken Access Control

It ensures users act only within their intended permissions. Flaws in this area allow unauthorized information disclosure, data modification, data destruction, or performing functions outside authorized limits.

**Examples:**

- A regular user accesses an administrator's page by simply changing a URL parameter.

- An application allows a user to view another user's account details by manipulating an ID in the request.

**Mitigation:**

- Deny all access by default; grant specific access rights explicitly.

- Validate access rights for every request to sensitive data or functionality.

## Cryptographic Failures

Sensitive data requires strong protection, both in transit and at rest. Cryptographic failures involve improper handling of encryption, leading to data exposure.

**Examples:**

- Storing passwords in plain text or using weak hashing algorithms.

- Transmitting sensitive data without encryption (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS).

- Using deprecated or weak cryptographic algorithms (e.g., MD5 for password hashing, ECB mode for encryption).

**Mitigation:**

- Encrypt all sensitive data in transit and at rest using strong, industry-standard algorithms (e.g., AES-256).

- Use strong, salted, and adaptive hashing functions for passwords (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2).

- Disable caching for responses containing sensitive data.

## Injection

Injection flaws allow attackers to send untrusted data to an interpreter as part of a command or query. This often leads to the execution of unintended commands or access to unauthorized data.

**Examples:**

- **SQL Injection:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries through input fields, gaining unauthorized database access. `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR 1=1 --'`

- **OS Command Injection:** An attacker executes arbitrary operating system commands through application input.

**Mitigation:**

- Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions.

- Implement strict input validation and sanitization.

- Avoid direct execution of OS commands with user-supplied input.

## Insecure Design

Security is an integral part of the design process,it reflects a lack of threat modeling and secure design patterns.

**Examples:**

- An application lacks a robust password recovery mechanism, making it vulnerable to account takeover.

- Failure to implement proper state management for multi-step processes allows users to skip steps.

- Designing an API endpoint implicitly trusts client-side input for critical operations.

- Omitting security controls in the design phase for specific business logic flows.

**Mitigation:**

- Implement a secure development lifecycle (SDL).

- Utilize security design principles like least privilege and defense-in-depth.

- Separate user and admin interfaces.

## Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Applications frequently rely on libraries, frameworks, and other software components. Using components with known vulnerabilities exposes the entire application.

**Examples:**

- An application uses an old version of a JavaScript library with a critical cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

- Running an outdated web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) with known exploits.

- Including unpatched open-source components in the application's build.

- Not regularly updating operating systems or database software.

**Mitigation:**

- Regularly audit and update all third-party components.

- Subscribe to security advisories for all used libraries and frameworks.

- Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify vulnerable components.

- Remove unused dependencies and features from your codebase.

## Identification and Authentication Failures

Properly identifying and authenticating users is foundational to security. Failures in this area allow attackers to impersonate legitimate users.

**Examples:**

- Weak or default passwords are easily guessed or brute-forced.

- Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA).

- Session management flaws, such as predictable session IDs or sessions that do not expire.

- Permitting verbose error messages that leak credential-related information.

**Mitigation:**

- Implement strong password policies, requiring complexity and regular changes.

- Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA).

- Implement secure session management, using strong, randomly generated session IDs and proper session expiration.

- Protect against brute-force attacks with rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms.

## Software and Data Integrity Failures

Integrity failures occur when code or data is compromised, either unintentionally or maliciously. This can lead to unauthorized access, malicious code execution, or data corruption.

**Examples:**

- An application downloads unsigned or unverified software updates, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.

- Lack of integrity checks on data stored in a database allows tampering.

- Update mechanisms do not verify the authenticity or integrity of updates.

**Mitigation:**

- Implement digital signatures or checksums for all software updates and critical data.

- Ensure secure configuration and patch management.

- Use trusted package repositories and verify the integrity of packages.

## Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

Inadequate logging and monitoring hinder incident detection and response. Without proper visibility, breaches go unnoticed for extended periods.

**Examples:**

- An application fails to log successful and failed login attempts.

- Lack of centralized logging makes it difficult to correlate events across different systems.

- No alerts configured for suspicious activities, such as multiple failed login attempts from a single IP address.

**Mitigation:**

- Implement comprehensive logging of security events (e.g., logins, access control failures, input validation errors).

- Ensure logs contain sufficient context for analysis.

- Centralize logs in a security information and event management (SIEM) system.

- Configure real-time alerts for suspicious activities.

## Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

SSRF allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain of the attacker's choosing. This can lead to internal network exposure or sensitive data leakage.

**Examples:**

- An application that accepts a URL as input for fetching a profile picture allows an attacker to point it to an internal network address.

- An attacker uses SSRF to scan internal ports or access cloud metadata services.

- Exploiting SSRF to retrieve sensitive files from the server's local file system.

- Accessing internal services that are not directly exposed to the internet.

**Mitigation:**

- Sanitize and validate all user-supplied URLs.

- Whitelisting: Only allow requests to known, trusted domains and protocols.

- Disable HTTP redirections.

- Implement network segmentation to restrict outbound connections from the application server.

- Use a "deny by default" approach for outbound requests.

- Do not send raw responses from the server to the client.

## Conclusion

The OWASP Top 10 serves as a powerful, direct roadmap for enhancing web application security. Addressing these common vulnerabilities systematically reduces risk and builds more resilient systems. Proactive engagement with these principles, from initial design through development and deployment, establishes a robust defense. Continual vigilance, regular security assessments, and prompt patching ensure applications remain secure against evolving threats.
