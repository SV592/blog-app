## The Pillars of Good Code

When writing code, especially in an interview setting, focus on these three fundamental principles:

1.  **Readability:** Code should be easy to understand by others and your future self.
2.  **Time Complexity:** How the execution time of your algorithm scales with the input size (e.g., O(n), O(n log n), O(n²)).
3.  **Space Complexity:** How the memory usage of your algorithm scales with the input size.

## What Interviewers Are Looking For

Interviewers assess a range of skills beyond just coding ability. They want to understand your thought process and how you fit into a team:

- **Analytical Skills:** Your ability to think through problems, break them down, and analyze different approaches.
- **Coding Skills:** Your proficiency in writing clean, simple, well-organized, and readable code.
- **Technical Knowledge:** Your understanding of the fundamental concepts relevant to the role.
- **Communication Skills:** How well you articulate your thoughts and interact, assessing your cultural fit within the company.

## Step-by-Step Through a Problem

A structured approach can significantly improve your performance in a coding interview:

### 1. Understanding the Problem

- **Listen Actively & Take Notes:** When the interviewer states the question, immediately jot down key constraints and details (e.g., "sorted array," "unique elements"). Ensure you capture all specifics.
- **Clarify Inputs & Outputs:** Double-check what data types the inputs will be and what format the output should take.
- **Identify the Main Goal:** What is the most important objective of this problem? Are there specific time or space complexity constraints? Focus on the core value you need to deliver.
- **Ask Thoughtful Questions:** Don't be afraid to ask clarifying questions, but make them insightful, not repetitive.

### 2. Exploring Solutions

- **Start with the Naive/Brute Force Approach:** Begin by describing the simplest solution that comes to mind, even if it's inefficient. This demonstrates your ability to generate a solution and think critically. You don't necessarily need to write this code, but articulate your thought process.
- **Discuss Inefficiencies:** Explain why the naive approach isn't optimal (e.g., "This would be O(n²), which is too slow for large inputs," or "It's not very readable").
- **Walk Through Your Optimized Approach:**
  - Describe your improved solution.
  - Look for repetition, potential bottlenecks (the part of the code with the largest Big O complexity), or unnecessary work.
  - Confirm you've utilized all the information given by the interviewer.
  - Focus on optimizing the bottleneck.

### 3. Planning and Coding

- **Pre-Code Walkthrough:** Before writing any code, verbally walk through your refined approach. Outline the exact steps you plan to follow.
- **Modularize Your Code:** Break your solution into smaller, manageable functions from the outset. Add concise comments where necessary to explain logic.
- **Start Coding:** Begin writing your code. Remember, thorough preparation and a clear plan beforehand are crucial for a smooth whiteboard experience. Never start coding if you're unsure of the path forward; clarify your plan first.

  - **Tip:** If you can't recall a specific method, create a placeholder function and note its intended purpose. The goal is to show your structure, even if a minor detail slips your mind. Start with the easiest parts.

### 4. Testing and Refinement

- **Error Checks and Edge Cases:** Think about how your code could break. Never make assumptions about input. Imagine "Darth Vader" trying to submit malicious or unexpected input.
  - **Trick:** Comment in your code the checks you intend to perform (e.g., `// TODO: Add check for empty array`).
  - After the interview, you would typically write tests to intentionally try and break your function, but you don't need to do that during the interview itself.
- **Meaningful Naming:** Avoid generic names like `i` and `j`. Use descriptive variable and function names that enhance readability.
- **Test Your Code (with the interviewer):** Walk through specific test cases:
  - No parameters
  - Zero, `undefined`, or `null` inputs
  - Massive arrays
  - Consider asynchronous behavior if applicable.
  - Ask the interviewer if you can make any assumptions about the input (e.g., "Can we assume the array will always contain integers?").
  - Poke holes in your own solution: "Could this return an error here?" "Am I repeating myself?"
- **Discuss Improvements and Alternatives:**
  - Does your current solution work?
  - Are there other approaches to this problem?
  - How could readability be further improved?
  - What would you Google to find better ways to solve parts of the problem?
  - How can performance be enhanced?
  - **(Optional)** You might ask the interviewer, "What's the most interesting solution you've seen to this problem?"

### 5. Extension Questions (Scale and Beyond)

If your interviewer is satisfied, they might ask extension questions. A common follow-up, especially at companies like Google that prioritize scale, is about handling inputs too large for memory or streaming data.

The typical answer involves a **divide-and-conquer strategy**: performing distributed processing, reading only specific chunks of data into memory, writing intermediate outputs back to disk, and combining them later. This demonstrates your understanding of large-scale systems.
