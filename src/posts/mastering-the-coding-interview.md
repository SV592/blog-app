## Interviewer Insights:

Interviewers evaluate a variety of skills, extending past simple coding proficiency. They want to understand your problem solving process and alignment with team:

- **Analytical Ability:** You break down problems into small sections, and eloborate on the solutions.
- **Coding Skills:** Your proficiency shines through clean, straightforward, organized, and easily digestible code.
- **Technical Foundations:** You have a solid grasp of role-relevant core concepts for that position.
- **Communication Skills:** You express your thoughts clearly and you can work well with others.

## Navigating a Problem:

A disciplined approach improves your interview performance significantly:

### 1. Problems

- **Engage & Document:** Take note of constraints and details as the interviewer reads the question. Note specific requirements like "sorted array" or "unique elements."
- **Inputs & Outputs:** Confirm input data types and the exact format expected for the output.
- **Main Objective:** Identify the problem's main goal and confirm any specific time or space complexity constraints.
- **Ask Questions:** Thoughtful inquiries help to showcase your understanding but make sure to avoid redundant queries.

### 2. Solutions

- **Initial Solution:** Describe the most direct solution first, even if it's inefficient. You can articulate your thought process without writing code.
- **Highlight Inefficiencies:** Explain the suboptimal aspects of the initial approach. For example, a O(n^2) solution might be too slow for extensive inputs.
- **Optimized Strategy:**
  - Present your refined solution.
  - Clean up the repetitive code, identify bottlenecks (the segment with the largest Big O complexity).
  - Confirm your utilization of all provided information.
  - Prioritize optimizing the bottleneck.

### 3. Implementation

- **Verbal Walkthrough:** Talk about your refined approach step-by-step before committing to any code.
- **Modularize Code:** Break your solution into smaller, manageable functions from the beginning. Add comments where the logic might need clarification.
- **Start Coding:** Thorough preparation and a good pre-coding plan pave the way for a good coding session.

  - **Tips:** If a specific method escapes your memory, create a placeholder function and note its intended purpose.

### 4. Refinement

- **Edge Cases:** Don't assume anything about the input data, prepare for unexpected inputs.
  - **Technique:** Integrate `TODO` comments in your code, outlining intended checks (e.g., `// TODO: Validate for empty array`).
- **Naming Conventions:** Don't use generic labels like `i` and `j`. Choose descriptive variable and function names that improve readability.
- **Testing (with the interviewer):** Conduct a walkthrough using specific test cases:
  - Absence of parameters.
  - Zero, `undefined`, or `null` inputs.
  - Consider asynchronous behavior, if applicable.
  - Solicit assumptions about input: "Could we assume integer-only arrays?".
  - Self-critique your solution: "Could this point introduce an error?" "Does redundancy exist here?".
  - **(Optional)** Engage with the interviewer: "What is the most intriguing solution you've encountered for this challenge?".

### Conclusion

Mastering coding interviews involves more than just writing code; it's about showcasing your problem-solving and communication skills. The key lies in a structured, five-step approach: thoroughly understanding the **Problem**, strategizing an optimized **Solution**, meticulous **Implementation**, and rigorous **Refinement** (including edge cases and testing). Adopting this methodology will allow you to approach any challenge confidently and succeed.
