### Layered Architecture (N-Tier Architecture)

Layered architecture organizes an application into hierarchical layers. Each layer holds a specific responsibility. Communication typically flows downwards, from higher layers to lower ones. The presentation layer manages user interfaces and interactions. The business layer handles core logic and rules. The persistence layer handles data storage interactions and the database layer represents the actual data management system.

This architecture offers clear separation of concerns, simplifying development and maintenance. Individual layers achieve independent testability. It supports scaling different parts of the application, although often as a combined unit.

**Use Case:** A traditional online banking system. The web application or mobile app forms the presentation layer. Business rules for transactions, account management, and security reside in the business layer. Data access components interact with the central customer and transaction databases in the persistence and database layers.

### Onion Architecture

Onion Architecture places the domain model and core business logic at its center. Dependencies exclusively flow inwards, ensuring inner layers remain independent of external infrastructure. Outer layers depend on inner layers, but never the reverse. This structure creates a highly testable core domain, seperate from external frameworks like databases or UI frameworks. It significantly enhances maintainability.

**Use Case:** A patient management system in healthcare. The core domain defines patient records, appointment scheduling rules, and medical history. Application services orchestrate these domain rules. Outer layers, such as a web UI, a REST API, or a database repository, implement interfaces defined by the inner domain, allowing flexible adoption of different technologies without impacting core logic.

### Hexagonal Architecture

Hexagonal Architecture, often called Ports and Adapters, isolates the application's core logic from external dependencies. The core application defines "ports," which are interfaces representing interactions with the outside world. "Adapters" then implement these ports, connecting the application to concrete technologies like user interfaces, databases, or third-party services. This pattern promotes robust decoupling and high testability, as simulating external dependencies becomes straightforward.

**Use Case:** An email marketing platform. The core application defines ports for sending emails and managing subscriber lists. Adapters connect to various email service providers (e.g., SendGrid, Mailchimp) or different database types (SQL, NoSQL) to fulfill these functionalities. This allows the core logic to remain independent of specific external services.

### Modular Architecture

Modular Architecture divides an application into self-contained, interchangeable modules. Each module encapsulates a specific feature or set of related functionalities. Modules communicate through public interfaces, minimizing internal dependencies between them. This approach significantly improves code organization. It facilitates parallel development by different teams. Modules often achieve high reusability across different parts of the system or even other projects.

**Use Case:** A large-scale enterprise content management (ECM) system. Separate modules manage document versioning, user authentication, search indexing, workflow automation, and reporting. Each module operates largely independently, exposing services for integration with other modules, allowing for focused development and deployment of features.

### Microkernel Architecture

Microkernel Architecture comprises a compact core system, the "microkernel," and a set of plug-in modules. The microkernel provides essential system functionalities and a robust mechanism for plug-ins to connect and extend the system's capabilities. Plug-ins offer specialized features, adding functionality without altering the core. This architecture offers exceptional extensibility. It supports dynamic addition or removal of features and maintains a lean and stable core system.

**Use Case:** Modern web browsers such as Chromium. The browser's core handles rendering, networking, and basic JavaScript execution. Numerous extensions and plug-ins provide specialized functionalities like ad blocking, developer tools, or PDF viewers, extending the browser's capabilities without modifying its fundamental engine.

### Event-Driven Architecture

Event-Driven Architecture focuses on the production, detection, consumption, and reaction to events. Components communicate indirectly by publishing and subscribing to events, which represent significant occurrences or state changes within the system. This architectural style promotes loose coupling between services. It offers high scalability and responsiveness, particularly suited for real-time applications and complex workflows.

**Use Case:** A ride-sharing application. When a passenger requests a ride, an "RideRequested" event is published. A dispatch service subscribes to find available drivers. A notification service subscribes to alert the passenger about driver assignment. A billing service subscribes to initiate payment processing upon ride completion.

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

CQRS separates the operations that write data (commands) from the operations that read data (queries). Commands represent imperative actions, performing write operations. Queries are declarative, retrieving data without producing side effects. This segregation allows for independent scaling and optimization of read and write models. It simplifies the design of complex domains by focusing on specific responsibilities and supports using different data storage mechanisms optimized for reads versus writes.

**Use Case:** An online retail platform. When a customer adds an item to their cart or places an order (commands), these operations target a write model optimized for transactional consistency. When customers browse product listings or view their order history (queries), these requests hit a read model, potentially a highly optimized, denormalized database or cache, for rapid retrieval.

### Microservices Architecture

Microservices Architecture structures an application as a collection of small, independent services. Each service runs in its own process and communicates through lightweight mechanisms, often using HTTP APIs. Each microservice focuses on a single business capability. This architecture promotes independent deployment of services. It allows for technology heterogeneity, meaning different services can use different programming languages or databases and offers enhanced scalability and resilience.

**Use Case:** A travel booking platform. Separate microservices handle flight search, hotel reservations, payment processing, user authentication, and notification delivery. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, enabling rapid feature development and high availability.

### Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture, drawing inspiration from Onion and Hexagonal patterns, emphasizes a separation of concerns into concentric layers. The innermost layer holds enterprise-wide business rules (entities). The next layer contains application-specific business rules (use cases). Outer layers consist of interface adapters (gateways, presenters, controllers), and the outermost layer includes frameworks and databases. This architecture ensures the business rules remain independent of UI, databases, and external frameworks, which results in highly testable and maintainable code.

**Use Case:** A financial trading system. Core financial algorithms and risk management rules reside in the innermost domain layer. Use cases define specific trading operations (e.g., "execute trade," "calculate portfolio value"). Outer layers provide interfaces to market data feeds, trading venues, and user dashboards, ensuring the core financial logic is isolated and robust.

### Monolithic Architecture

Monolithic Architecture builds an application as a single, indivisible unit. All components, including the user interface, business logic, and data access layers, reside within a single codebase and deploy as one cohesive package. This architecture offers simplicity in initial development for smaller applications. It provides straightforward deployment for a single unit. Debugging can be simpler due to a unified codebase.

**Use Case:** An initial prototype for a project management tool. All features, from task creation and user management to data storage and reporting, are tightly integrated within a single application codebase. This approach facilitates rapid initial development and deployment.

### Conclusion

Each pattern, from Layered to Microservices, and specialized forms like Onion, Hexagonal, Event-Driven, and CQRS, offers distinct advantages. The choice directly impacts a project's scalability, maintainability, and longevity. A well-considered architectural decision, aligning with specific project needs and vision, forms the bedrock for robust, adaptable software.
